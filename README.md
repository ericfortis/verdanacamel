#VerdanaCamel

A proportional sans-serif font with extra left padding in capital case letters. And wider a space glyph.

Modified with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/).

##To do
- Larger return ligature
- Ligature for `...`
- Ligature for `../` (for directories ../../)
- Ligature for `()`
- Ligature for `export` (not so fancy as return but more visible)
- Ligature for `throw` (not so fancy as return but more visible)
- Ligature for `then` in the bold font (but to make lighter and thinner)
- Ligature for `this` (smaller)
- Ligature for `async` and `await` (maybe italic)
- More space around `/` for imports (bold and regular)
- More space around `.` (but not much more)
- More space around `(` and `)`
- More space before `M` 


##Other thoughts
- Try another font, because this one is too large (byte size). (I guess because of the bold offset)
- Alternatively, in monospaced fonts, condense capital case letters.
