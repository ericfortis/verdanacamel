#VerdanaCamel

A proportional sans-serif font with extra left padding in capital case letters. And wider a space glyph.

Modified with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/).

##To do
- Ligatures for `::`
- Ligature for `export` (not so fancy as return but more visible)
- More space around `/`
- More space around `.`
- More space around `(` and `)`
- More space before `M` 
- Smaller `this`
- Try another font, because this one is too large. (I guess because of the bold offset)

##Other thoughts
This effect can be simulated in monospaced fonts by condensing capital case letters.
